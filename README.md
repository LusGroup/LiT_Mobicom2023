# LiT: Toothbrushing Monitoring System
LiT is a toothbrushing monitoring system based on a commercial LED toothbrush. It utilizes commercial blue light sterilization toothbrushes, where blue LEDs are used as transmitters, and only 2 low-cost photosensors are required to be mounted on the toothbrush head as receivers. LiT is capable of monitoring 16 Bass technique surfaces by analyzing the dynamic light intensity change.
